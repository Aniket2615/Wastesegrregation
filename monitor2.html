    Metallic waste segregation holds vital importance within waste management systems due to its significant contributions to resource conservation, environmental sustainability, and economic value. By separating metallic waste from general refuse, this practice facilitates efficient recycling, curtails environmental pollution, conserves valuable resources, and supports the development of a circular economy, reducing the need for virgin materials while mitigating the ecological impact of metal waste disposal.</p>
